# 0. Preparation

Before talking about the routine itself, here are the tools and resources I'm using daily.

## 0.1. Notion for keeping track of my readings

A friend introduced me to this tool last year and I could successfully integrate it into different routines that I have. If you don't know it already, it's similar to Evernote. You can create an account [there](http://https://www.notion.so).  
I'm using notion to keep track and label the papers I'm reading. Sometimes I also write notes.

<div className="text-center">![Figure 2](/static/images/paper-reading-routine/notion2.png)</div>
## 0.2. Resources I'm using mainly 3 websites: - www.arxiv-sanity.com/ - https://paperswithcode.com/
- https://scholar.google.com/

# 1. The routine

## 1.1. Step 1: Looking at the newest papers

Everyday the first thing I'm doing is visiting **arxiv-sanity** `most recent`.

<div className="text-center">
  ![Figure 3](/static/images/paper-reading-routine/axiv-sanity1.png)
</div>
At this point, I'm reading mainly the titles and rapidly the abstracts. Usually, I open 2-3 papers that
might interest me in a new tab.

## 1.2. Step 2: Getting the general idea

For each paper, I'm opening the pdf.

- **The abstract**  
  The abstract is very useful and will give you an idea of the content. I usually read it a few times before starting to read the paper itself.
- **End of the introduction**  
  Then I'm reading the end of the introduction. Usually, the authors sum up the most important points of their contribution by writing "Our contribution..." or "In this work...".
  <div className="text-center">
    ![Figure 4](/static/images/paper-reading-routine/our-contribution.png)
  </div>
  The next part is often `related work`. If I only want to get a general idea on the paper I'm skipping
  this.
- **Diagram which represents the method**  
  It is common that the authors are providing a diagram of their method. Sometimes I'm totally lost looking at it though...
  <div className="text-center">![Figure 5](/static/images/paper-reading-routine/diagram.png)</div>
- **Experimentations**  
  Finally, I'm looking at the experimentations. This can be super tricky to read though, so I don't really rely on a simple overview of the results. I'm more interested in the datasets and to what the actual work is compared with (baselines).

## 1.3. Step 3: paperswithcode

Then I'm usually visiting https://paperswithcode.com/. I feel less intuitive to use that axiv-sanity but it has other advantages. I totally ignore the feed `Trending` and go directly to `Latest`. Since it's mostly redundant with what I just did, I'm doing this very fast. I mostly look at the git repositories briefly if I see a lot of stars.

# 2. Recommendations and Advice

## 2.1. How to choose the topic(s)

In the beginning, I was quite lost about the topic I should focus on. So I read all the titles that looked interesting. Step by step I could focus on specific topics: compression (pruning, quantization, etc), neural architecture search, self-supervised learning, IoT/tinyML.

## 2.2. Going deeper

Sometimes I want to go deeper in a specific field. For that, I'm using the `related work` section and https://scholar.google.com/ to find related recent works with the button `Cited by ...`. Arxiv has a similar feature.

<div className="text-center">![Figure 7](/static/images/paper-reading-routine/cited.png)</div>
## 2.3. Understanding I personally often don't get exactly how a method is working. But that's ok. If
I really need to understand the paper, I'm just spending more time on it. Sometimes 2 or 3 hours.

## 2.4. Conferences

Some very talented people are writing summaries of the main conferences. This can be super useful!

## 2.5. State-of-the-art

When I want to know the SOTA in a specific topic (often to compare with the experimentation section of a paper) I'm using paperswithcode.

<div className="text-center">
  ![Figure 8](/static/images/paper-reading-routine/paperswithcode.png)
</div>
## 2.6. Hype Even by doing this every day, I often miss great papers. So 3-4 times per month I check
the section `top hype` and `top recent` of arxiv-sanity. Twitter is also a great way to get the latest
trends.

# 3. Conclusion

I could make this routine a real habit and read about 200 papers since January. My paper tracker is publicly available [here](https://t.co/CJ0dEVtU7e?amp=1). Hope this can be useful for you!
