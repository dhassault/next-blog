# Introduction

Github actions was [released in 2019](https://github.blog/2019-08-08-github-actions-now-supports-ci-cd/#:~:text=We%20hope%20you'll%20try,to%20hear%20what%20you%20think!) aiming at providing a new tool to build your [CI/CD pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD). You can leverage the cache to accelerate your pipelines and decrease your bill. Let’s see how to do this when using `python` and `poetry`.

# Before

So far I was installing `poetry` with [abatilo/actions-poetry](https://github.com/abatilo/actions-poetry) and then setting up the cache manually using [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache). That was not straightforward to set up, especially when you have to test in the CI directly. Using https://github.com/nektos/act to run Github actions locally helped marginally. But I just noticed that an official action was released to do the same thing simpler.

# Updated Version

By using [actions/setup-python@v4](https://github.com/actions/setup-python). It implements its caching logic and is compatible with `poetry`. But when I tried it first, it didn’t work. I’m using the following `poetry.toml` to standardize `poetry`'s behavior among the team:

```text
[cache]
cache-dir = "./.cache/"
[virtualenvs]
create = true
in-project = true
```

This caused https://github.com/actions/setup-python not to be able to find the `.venv`. I could solve it by forcing the config before running the `poetry install` command:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: 3.9
    cache: 'poetry'
- run: poetry config virtualenvs.in-project false && poetry install
```

The whole workflow is available [here](https://gist.github.com/dhassault/1bd6b16dba0879107846c51b00d62ac6).
