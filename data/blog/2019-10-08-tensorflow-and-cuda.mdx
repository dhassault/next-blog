summary: "I had some trouble using TensorFlow 2.0 with my GPU without using Docker. Sometimes my cuda version is not compatible with the TensorFlow build, other times it's about cudnn ... Using Anaconda makes your life easier!"
---

When creating an environment with Anaconda, the key is to install cuda and cudnn **before** TensorFlow.

But let's first set a virtual environment using Anaconda:

```bash
conda create --name my_env python=3.7
```

Then when it's finished, you can install the package `cudatoolkit` and `cudnn` from conda directly. But first, be sure you download the right version! TensorFlow builds are compatible with specific cuda versions. In my case, TensorFlow 2.0 is compatible with cuda 10.0 so I have to install this specific version.

You can check which version and which build is available:

```bash
conda search cudatoolkit
                                                                                                                                                                        Loading channels: done
# Name                       Version           Build  Channel
cudatoolkit                      9.0      h13b8566_0  pkgs/main
cudatoolkit                      9.2               0  pkgs/main
cudatoolkit                 10.0.130               0  pkgs/main
cudatoolkit                 10.1.168               0  pkgs/main
```

As we can see cuda 10.0 is available. Now let's take a loot at cudnn :

```bash
conda search cudnn

Loading channels: done
# Name                       Version           Build  Channel
cudnn                          7.0.5       cuda8.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.1.2       cuda9.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.1.3       cuda8.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.2.1       cuda9.2_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.3.1      cuda10.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.3.1       cuda9.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.3.1       cuda9.2_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.6.0      cuda10.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.6.0      cuda10.1_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.6.0       cuda9.0_0  pkgs/main
cudnn                          7.6.0       cuda9.2_0  pkgs/main
```

Here you can see there is version 7.6.0 for cuda 10.0. So we can install those packages:

```bash
conda install cudatoolkit=10.0.130
```

And:

```bash
conda install cudnn=7.6.0=cuda10.0_0
```

Then you can install TensorFlow:

```bash
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```

Finally, to make sure everything works correctly, in your conda environment, you can run:

```bash
python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 22:11:17)
[GCC 7.3.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

Make sure the output looks similar.

Then:

```python
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> tf.__version__
'2.0.0'
>>> print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))

```

And you can also run this small snippet from tensorflow.org to be sure:

```python
tf.debugging.set_log_device_placement(True)

# Create some tensors
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
b = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])
c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print(c)
```

If the code is running without any errors, your GPU is ready to work hard!
